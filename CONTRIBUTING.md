# Contributing

First of - thank you for using this project and willingness to contribute ❤️

## Getting started

Main goal of the project is to provide a quick way to create production ready Django apps.
Due to complexity of such goal solution implemented is highly opinionated and may not fit everyone's needs.

- all changes must comply with [Reef Technologies conventions](https://github.com/reef-technologies/handbook#73-conventions)
- before putting a lot of effort into a PR with a feature, please open an issue to discuss it first to avoid wasting time on something that may not be merged.
  - the rule of thumb is that if it is not useful for 90% of projects, it should not be included

## Development

Before creating PR run:

```sh
nox
```

to check if everything is OK.
